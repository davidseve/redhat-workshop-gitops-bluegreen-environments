== Step 1 - Deploy new version

We will start deploying a new version `v1.1.1` in the offline color. And get it ready to received online user`s traffic

Those are the main tasks that we have to execute:

- Set new tag image values in the offline color.
- Change the application configuration values to use the online services.
- Scale Up the offline color.
- Commit the changes in a new branch and create a pull request.

If we do not automate those tasks, we will have to see which is the offline color and make all the changes in the right values files.
However, we can automate it in a pipeline. The pipelines will find the offline color, make the changes in the right values files and create the pull request.

We can get the offline color from Openshift service or from the file `values/products/envs/{environment}/non-static-networking-values.yaml`. Then edit the following files in the right environment and color.

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart
----
- Set new tag image values in the offline color.

Edit the file `values/products/envs/{environment}/green/image-tag-values.yaml`.
Set this content to deploy new version `v1.1.1`
```yaml
products-green:
  quarkus-base:
    image:
      tag: v1.1.1
```
- Change the application configuration values to use the online services.
- Scale Up the offline color.

Edit the file `values/products/envs/{environment}/green/non-static-values.yaml`.
Set this content to use online backend and scale up.
```yaml
products-green:
  quarkus-base:
    replicaCount: 2
  mode: online
```

Commit the changes in a new branch and create a pull request
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git checkout -b new-image-v1.1.1
git add values/products/envs/{environment}/green
git commit -m 'products-green  new image tag v1.1.1'
git push origin new-image-v1.1.1

Automatic pipeline::

We have created a pipeline that:

- Get the offline color in the designed environment.
- Change the right files to deploy a new version.
- Commit the changes in a new branch and create a pull request.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$run-products-{environment}/1-pipelinerun-products-new-version.yaml[]
----

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -f 1-pipelinerun-products-new-version.yaml -n {user}-continuous-deployment

You should have the following pull request:

.GitHub New Version Pull Request
image::github-pr1-{environment}.png[]

With those files changed:

.GitHub New Version Pull Request Files Changed
image::gihub-{environment}-pr1-changed.png[]

Accept pull request and delete the branch.

ArgoCD will synchronize the application with the new changes. You can do it manually, to make it faster, clicking on `SYNC`` button.

.Argo CD - Refresh Shop

After ArgoCD synchronize, this will be the Shop status:

.Shop step 1
image::blue-green-step-1.png[]

See that offline color has version `v1.1.1` and the new attribute description, but the online has not changed.

{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{
            "discounts":[...],
            "metadata":{
               "version":"v1.0.1",
               "colour":"blue",
               "mode":"online" <--
            }
        }, 
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
     "colour":"green",
     "mode":"online" <--
  }
}
```
Functional testing users can execute `Smoke tests` to validate this new `v1.1.1` version.


== Step 2 - Switch new version to Online


We are going to open the new version to final users. To do so we just have to change the online service to use the other color that we have ready.

Those are the main tasks that we have to execute:

- Change the online service
- Commit the changes in a new branch and create a pull request.

include::promote-rollback-{environment}.adoc[]

== Step 3 - Align and scale down Offline

Finally, when online is stable we should align offline with the new version and scale it down. Does not make sense to use the same resources that we have in online.

Those are the main tasks that we have to execute:

- Set new tag image values in the new offline color.
- Change the application configuration values to use the offline services.
- Scale Down the new offline color.
- Change the offline service to use the new offline color.
- Commit the changes in a new branch and create a pull request.

Set this content to use online backend and scale up.

- Change the offline service to use the new offline color.
Edit the file `values/products/envs/{environment}/non-static-networking-values.yaml`.
Set this content to use the green color in the online service.
```yaml
productsNetworkingOnline:
  version: green
productsNetworkingOffline:
  version: blue
```

We can see that the offline `Products` is calling offline `Discounts` and has the new version `v1.1.1`
