TODO delete
{user} 

This section consists of three steps. First, get access to Openshift and ArgoCD and clone the GitOps repository. Second, deploy the application of both environments. Third, test that the deployment went well.


[#04-access-the-tools]
== Access the tools

This section focuses on getting access to the four tools that we are going to use to control the deployment of the Shop application:

* *OCP Client*: The `oc` command will be used to create Openshift resources as well as to debug the application configuration.
* *OCP Web console*: The Openshift web console will be used to create Openshift resources as well as to debug the application configuration.
* *ArgoCD web console*: This web console helps us to visualize the sync status between Git and Openshift.
* *Clone the GitOps repo*: This repository contains all the deployment configurations of the application and it's the only source of truth of the configuration.


=== 1. Openshift - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system. With the `oc` command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal.

Please check that you have followed the pre-requisites with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing the next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u {user}  -p openshift {cluster_api}
----

If the login is successful, it should show an output similar to the following screenshot:

.OC CLI Login Output
image::oc_login_output.png["OC CLI Login Output"]

TIP: Please pay special attention to _oc CLI_  because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.

As shown in the output, the user will have access to the following namespaces:

* *{user}-continuous-deployment*: It will contain all the pipelines.
* *{user}-prod*: Will contain the application in the production environment.
* *{user}-stage*: Will contain the application in the staging environment.

Each user will have its own three namespaces.

=== 2. Openshift - Web Console

Access the https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-pdlf2.pdlf2.sandbox2869.opentlc.com/k8s/cluster/projects[OCP web console^] and login with your assigned username and password:

* Username: {user}.
* Password: `openshift`.

Once logged in, you will see the same namespaces as using the `oc` command:

.OCP web console projects view
image::ocp_console_projects.png["OCP web console projects view"]


=== 3. ArgoCD dashboard
 
The ArgoCD web console will give you access to control how the git repo is synced with Openshift, as well as check the real status of the synchronization. In order to log in to the web console, access the Openshift web console and click on the following icon: You will get the link to the ArgoCD web console:

.Openshift link to the ArgoCD web console
image::ocp_console_argocd_link.png["Openshift link to the ArgoCD web console"]

You will be requested to Log in to ArgoCD. Click on `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` to be prompted for your Openshift credentials.

.ArgoCD login screen
image::argocd_login.png["ArgoCD login screen"]

If the login is successful, you will see the home screen where your applications will be created.

=== 4. Clone the GitOps repository

Following the GitOps practices, all the deployment configuration is stored in the git repo. We have created an initial repository that you will change to configure your deployment. As part of the demo, you will have to do some changes and commits. Fork the repository and clone it in your local machine, as you don't have write permissions on the initial git repo.

1. Access the https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies[cloud-native-deployment-strategies] repository and fork it on your GitHub account. If prompted, choose to fork the `main` branch.
2. Now, in your forked repository, go to `Settings > General > Pull Requests` and configure the repo to `Automatically delete head branches` after a PR is merged.

3. Finally, clone the repository and change to a new branch `release` using the following commands: 

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/your_user/cloud-native-deployment-strategies
cd cloud-native-deployment-strategies
git checkout -b release
git push origin release
----


== The Shop application

The shop application consists of two Quarkus applications dubbed *products* and *discounts*. When a user requests a product using the Products API, it retrieves the discount information from the Discounts microservice and then responds with all the information.

.Shop app architecture
image::shop_architecture.png["Shop app architecture"]

One of the best ways to package Cloud Native applications is *Helm*, as it provides a layer of abstraction that can simplify deployment whilst providing a method of repeatability. In the repository that you just forked, you will find a set of Helm charts used to deploy each of the components of the application.

[source, console]
----
helm
├── quarkus-helm-base        # Defines basic config of all microservices.
├── quarkus-helm-discounts   # Deployment config for the Discounts micro.
├── quarkus-helm-networking  # Deployment config for the Networking components.
├── quarkus-helm-products    # Deployment config for the Products micro.
└── quarkus-helm-umbrella    # Main chart that combines them all.
----

With the previous https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#complex-charts-with-many-dependencies[`umbrella` structure], each chart defines a set of Openshift resources with default values. The `umbrella` chart will be our tool to combine them all and override the variables we need.

We will use this application to test the *Blue/Green deployment* strategy.



[#04-deploy-the-shop]
== Deploy Shop in Stage and Prod environments

NOTE: From now on, you will always modify the configuration of the repository that you just forked, as you have read-only permissions in the initial repository.

In this section, we will create an ArgoCD `ApplicationSet` that will configure the synchronization of the git repository and Openshift. At this point, we need to stop for a bit and explain what is an ArgoCD `Application` and `ApplicationSet`.

* An `Application` is an ArgoCD CRD that represents a deployed application instance in an environment. It basically synchronizes the K8s resources definitions with the actual objects deployed on Openshift.
* An `ApplicationSet` allows you to automatically and dynamically generate ArgoCD `Application`. We will use them to generate several Applications based on the `values.yaml` files of the git repo.


Please, edit the following file and set your own GitHub repository in the reportURL.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$argocd/applicationset-shop.yaml[]
----

Now, create the `ApplicationSet` in OpenShift:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f applicationset-shop.yaml -n openshift-gitops 
----

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new Shop application for each environment stage and prod. We can test that it is up and running.

[#04-test-deployment]
== Test Shop in stage environment

=== Online 
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n {user}-stage --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
----

=== Offline

curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-offline -n {user}-stage --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version`, `color`, and `mode` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have the same version v1.0.1 in both colors we will have almost the same response, only the mode will change.
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{
           "discounts":[
              {
                 "name":"BlackFriday",
                 "price":"1350€",
                 "discount":"10%"
              }
           ],
           "metadata":{
              "version":"v1.0.1",
              "colour":"blue",
              "mode":"online" <--
           }
        },
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€"
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.0.1",
     "colour":"blue",
     "mode":"online" <--
  }
}
```

== Test Shop in prod environment

=== Online 
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n {user}-prod --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
----

=== Offline 
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-offline -n {user}-prod --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
----

We will have the same response in Prod environment.
