= The Shop application

include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section consists of two steps. First, deploy the application of both environments. Third, test that the deployment went well.


== The application

The shop application consists of two Quarkus applications dubbed *products* and *discounts*. When a user requests a product using the Products API, it retrieves the discount information from the Discounts microservice and then responds with all the information.

One of the best ways to package Cloud Native applications is *Helm*, as it provides a layer of abstraction that can simplify deployment whilst providing a method of repeatability. In the repository that you just forked, you will find a set of Helm charts used to deploy each of the components of the application.

[source, console]
----
helm
├── quarkus-helm-base        # Defines basic config of all microservices.
├── quarkus-helm-discounts   # Deployment config for the Discounts micro.
├── quarkus-helm-networking  # Deployment config for the Networking components.
├── quarkus-helm-products    # Deployment config for the Products micro.
└── quarkus-helm-umbrella    # Main chart that combines them all.
----

With the previous https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#complex-charts-with-many-dependencies[`umbrella` structure], each chart defines a set of Openshift resources with default values. The `umbrella` chart will be our tool to combine them all and override the variables we need.

The values of the Umbrella Chart are split into several files to allow reusability. The following piece of code shows them all:

[source, console]

As you can see in the previous tree, there are several values files that are combined to generate each application using its Helm chart. For example, to deploy `discounts` in `production` in the `blue` color, ArgoCD will combine the following files:

* *static-discounts-values.yaml*: Proper configuration of the app that will not change independently of the environment: Prometheus endpoint, ports, etc.
* *non-static-networking-values.yaml*: The color to which each off/online route should point: Blue or Green.
* *image-tag-values.yaml*: Version of the application.
* *non-static-values.yaml*: Number of replicas and to which color it should point at.

We will use this application to test the *Blue/Green deployment* strategy.



[#04-deploy-the-shop]
== Deploy Shop in Stage and Prod environments

NOTE: From now on, you will always modify the configuration of the repository that you just forked, as you have read-only permissions in the initial repository.

In this section, we will create an ArgoCD `ApplicationSet` that will configure the synchronization of the git repository and Openshift. At this point, we need to stop for a bit and explain what is an ArgoCD `Application` and `ApplicationSet`.

* An `Application` is an ArgoCD CRD that represents a deployed application instance in an environment. It basically synchronizes the K8s resources definitions with the actual objects deployed on Openshift.
* An `ApplicationSet` allows you to automatically and dynamically generate ArgoCD `Application`. We will use them to generate several Applications based on the `values.yaml` files of the git repo.


Please, edit the following file and set your own GitHub repository in the reportURL.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$argocd/applicationset-shop.yaml[]
----

Now, create the `ApplicationSet` in OpenShift:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f applicationset-shop.yaml -n openshift-gitops 
----

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you will notice that we have a new Shop application for each environment: Stage and prod. Now, we can test that it is up and running.

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version`, `color`, and `mode` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have the same version v1.0.1 in both colors we will have almost the same response, only the mode will change.
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{
           "discounts":[
              {
                 "name":"BlackFriday",
                 "price":"1350€",
                 "discount":"10%"
              }
           ],
           "metadata":{
              "version":"v1.0.1",
              "colour":"blue",
              "mode":"online" <--
           }
        },
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€"
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.0.1",
     "colour":"blue",
     "mode":"online" <--
  }
}
```

== Test Shop in the Prod environment

=== Online 
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n {user}-prod --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
----

=== Offline 
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-offline -n {user}-prod --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"

We will have the same response in Prod environment.
