[#02-argocd-application]
== ArgoCD application
We have used GitOps to install the cluster. This is the ArgoCD application that we have used:
[source,yaml]

[#02-argocd-projects]
== ArgoCD Projects
We have also configured ArgoCD to manage different users with different privileges. We have created one ArgoCD AppProject per user:

Each user in ArgoCD can not see the other user`s ArgoCD AppProject.

[#02-ocp-namespaces]
== Openshift namespaces
For each user, we have created 3 namespaces. Two for the environments stage and prod, and one for the continuous deployment pipelines:

 - {user}-stage
 - {user}-prod
 - {user}-continuous-deployment

Each user in Openshift can not see the other user`s namespaces.

[#02-ocp-pipelines]
== Openshift Pipelines
We install the Openshift Pipelines Operator and all the necessary pipelines and tasks for continuous deployment:

- cluster role `tekton-admin-view`.
- role binding for ArgoCD and Pipelines to the namespaces.
- `pipelines-blue-green-environment` the pipelines that we will see later for Blue/Green deployment.
- Tekton cluster role.
- Tekton tasks for git and Openshift clients.

[#02-summary]
== Summary
The objective is to isolate the user as if they were teams that are working in the same cluster. And we do not want one team that can see the other team`s applications.

This is an example of how we can use ArgoCD RBAC and Openshift namespaces. But each organization should design its more suitable approach.
